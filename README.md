# Image-rotate

ðŸ”„ Rotating Images with HTML, CSS & JavaScript ðŸ’»ðŸ–¼

I recently built a feature that allows an image to rotate on command using HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript to control the interaction. By leveraging CSS transforms for rotation and JavaScript events to trigger the action, users can rotate the image with the click of a button. This functionality adds a dynamic and engaging element to the web page, enhancing user interaction.

The main challenge was ensuring that the rotation was smooth across different browsers and devices, especially when adding transitions for a better user experience. Another challenge was maintaining layout stability during rotation and handling different image sizes.

Takeaway: This project taught me the importance of balancing aesthetics and functionality in interactive design. JavaScript and CSS combined offer powerful ways to enhance visual elements and improve user engagement.
